Project description:
The objective of this program is to output the length, width, perimeter, and area of three rectangles and one square.

Date:
September 8th, 2021.

Class:
CS 117 section 002.

Notes and Assumptions:
 The process of repeating code felt ongoing, but it was not difficult to keep creating rectangles. Writing the code
 multiple times helped me gain a better fundamental understanding of how C++ works and it was great practice. This
 process works, but there are many ways to accomplish the same result. I would consider using rectangle classes or loops
 because it would repeat the code and would allow access to shortcuts throughout programming. In this instance, I could
 have also reused the same variable or an array. A square is also a rectangle, so I wonder if it would make it simpler
 if there was one code for both because it is smart to avoid repeating code.
